# Cube-sphere with 6 separate mesh faces

Following the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHRhDEVwDho, which is, in turn, based on Sebastian Lague's work.

## Part 1
This looks fine with the default material, but I suspect the lack of information of neighboring triangle normals at the edges of the faces will lead to visible seams / texturing issues at some point. Maybe not, and this is just simpler.

## Part 3
Starting to get some interesting results (especially with resolution = 1024 to get detail + hide seams!):
